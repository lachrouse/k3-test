# K3 Tool

The purpose of this software is to both automate a time consuming task and to improve my Python development skills. This script is based upon a KPI tracking system I have used previously in my work.

The script takes two datasets, one of sales data for each month and the other of salesperson data matching salespeople to customer accounts.
The script outputs a series of graphs and tables which are used to evaluate the saalespersons performance. 

Disclaimer - the datasets are not those of the previous company, they are made up to be representative.
